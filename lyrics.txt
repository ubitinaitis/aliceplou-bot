You've got this golden way of making my body sway|Of making my mind fly away, of making it fly
It's the world I love to be in|Come on, let's go high above the ceiling|Oh, we could be feeling, oh, what we could be feeling
I'm one of those witches, babe|I'm one of those witches, babe|Just don't try to save me, 'cause|I don't wanna be saved
Me, I've got my own little magic|And I'm not trying to wreak havoc|It's just that sometimes I see something and I just need to have it
Last night when you pulled through|I put a spell on the moon|It was three times the size in your moon-lit eyes
And I sang you an old tune|Mom sang me when I was half the size|And I looked at you and your moon-lit eyes
She cut a hole in the fence and she ran|She left her troublesome prison behind
She didn't wanna fuel the fire|She didn't wanna lose her desire
She looked out out to the horizon|She didn't have much left to see
Greed had taken the trees away|Greed had taken the bees away
She don't know where she gonna go now|She looked up to where there should've been stars
She said I wanna go to Mars|And this, this planet ain't ours
No rules, no rules|You said there were no rules|Your eyes familiar whirlpools|The doors right into you
And I'll let you in|No need to ask|I wanna bask in your everything
My chest exploding|My mind eroding|At the thought of you existing
All you had to do was see me|Really see me|Recognize the workings of my mind|And then touch me
And as you take a vow to never lie to me|All of my senses are screaming at me|My body one big lump of tingling, ah!
Imagining you naked in front of me|Nothing to hide, just someone to hold|And then we let go|'Cause we always let go
Carved from the same tree|Made of the same stuff|I couldn’t even bluff|No flirting, no skirting on the edge|You were one with me already
Wrapped up in the golden light of my bedroom|You take one look at me and I swoon|I'm here with you
Oh, I'm here with you|It hasn't been so easy being lonely|Oh, I'm here with you|It hasn't been so easy being lonely
Thank you for showing me|That I'm not alone|Thank you for showing me|That I’m not alone
You're making my skin wanna crawl into all of these cracks and these crevices
Don't worry I know how to have a good time|Just don't need to smile to be enjoying myself|Don't put me on a shelf
I'm not here for your enjoyment, your amusement|I don't need to have a reason, no|Don't need to have a reason at all|Don't need to have a prince at my ball
How about right now I'm my own prince|Maybe I wouldn't cease to exist|Without a man to do the hard things
Maybe you picked the wrong girl|But there's not one girl|Who deserves your aggression
I'll give you a confession|I used to fall for this bullshit|But let's stop regressing
How about I take your patriarchy, your misogyny|And I put it in the backyard|And set fire to it
You didn't teach me, I taught myself through you|You didn't heal me, but I healed from the things that you do
We didn't want each other, baby, we wanted something so much more|To feel the rarest of feelings that which opens all doors
Don't shut them all too quickly, there might not always be more|I'll spread your love so thickly so I can reminisce some more
Even if we're done for|Even if it's really sore|I'll take it all, take it all, take it all
Sometimes it feels like I could give it all up to be held by you|But that's not all the time, no, not all the time
Only when I can't breathe|Only when I wanna believe|Only when it's late at night|Only when I don't feel right
Only when I touch my body|Only when I'm feeling naughty|Only when you're far away, far away, far away
I dance with myself, like there is nobody else in the world|I fall to the floor and I fill the whole room with salty tears
I swim out of the window and into the night|I am smiling, I am screaming, I am glowing from inside|Do I dare to feel this feeling?
Oh how you looked at me like you'd forgotten why we're here|Where we're going, what it all means
It might all mean nothing, but you mean something to me
I squeeze a little tighter and suddenly, I'm holding my own body
There's an empty space whеre you once offerеd yourself to me
My mom knows I'll be alright, but she'll be glad I'm home|She's always casting spells for me|Keeping guard for me, working hard for me
Oh, she told me she gets lonely|When the sky changes from day to night|That's when all her demons come say "Hey"|Dusk is always harder for my baby
So I told her not to be afraid|That I'd think of her at that time of day
So I think about when her eyes light up|I think about when her eyes light up
The world, the whole wide world|But the world don't matter|When we're looking at each other
Oh, she's got this way of making you feel like|You've lived a thousand times and nеver gonna die
And she shinеs illuminated by the strobe light|She smiles and everything will be alright
Sweet talking my way through another funny day|I'm not here in the first place, I've been replaced
Haven't quite met this new self of mine, tell me it'll all be fine|Tell me I don't need to say the lines
I'm fine getting stoned alone, with all of this time|Maybe I'll finally be mine
Dressing myself for the day, like I'm on my way to the grand parade|I catch my eye in the mirror and smile back at myself
Openеd up some boxes that are fillеd with pieces of me|All of those years trying to squeeze into boxes that didn't fit all of me
I realize what it all means when I'm looking into mother's eyes|I'm looking into mother's eyes
I'm sitting in the corner of my mind|I don't mean to sit here so much of the time
Tears rolling, I'm shaking, but I'm fine|I'll be running into you all the time
I want you, but I don't want you to be mine|Feels like the paradox of my life
Loving you's the cure and the crime|Loving you's the cure and the crime
The words are there, they're knocking at our teeth|I'm feeling bare and hot head to feet|I've got nowhere to go and no one to meet
I see it now, I see my heart beat|I see it now, I see what I need|To be sitting in the corner of my mind
Be brutally honest, be brutally honest to me|With my whole world as your witness, lay it all on me
I don't want you to hold back any little thing|I'm ready to have my heart broken
I'll blow wind in your sails, I'll even walk you to the door|But please tell me what you really think, what you really think|Of me, of me
I think I need your words to feel like daggers in this love|For only then could I give up the hope in my heart
For each time that I try to put out my hope|A little flame lingers and I'm back on your door
So be brutally honest to me, baby, I know you can|It'll help me to get out whilе I still can
Has it started or is it already over?|The way you looked at me made me want to believe|That there's something
Take me to bed and do the things that we said we wouldn't do|But what can you do when it's too hard not to
It's heavy and it's light as air|You know it, I've seen how you stare
You're giving me something rare|Oh, how it's been fueling my flare|How beautiful to really care
Lie down on that bed of clouds, I wanna come down from spinning round
Standing too close to fire, wanna play it cool but also wanna get higher
I'll be there for you whatever you wanna do|I'll be fine, I'll be fine, let's do it right this time
I want nothing, I want it all now|I've got a dirty mouth, I’m not gonna wash it out
I've got baggage, it's got big wheels|I’ve got a little dog, biting at my heels
I'm not gonna heal you, not gonna make your dreams come true...|Don't touch me, don't even look at me!
I've got laser beams coming out my eyes|Do you still really, wanna mess with me?
I got tough 'cause I had enough|I was a girl with a big heart and they really roughed me up
My body fell asleep when they took it away from me|But I got it back, now I do what I like with it|Do what I like with it, do what I like with it, yeah
Show me your soft spot, have some pillow talk|Your sweat tastes salty, your brakes are faulty
Watch the sky, don't feel shame|Talking back, don't feel shame
Saying no, saying no, saying no|Dressed up, letting go, letting go
Dirty mouth, don’t feel shame|Stepping out of the frame
You're not ready for the comedown, it'll turn it all upside do~o~own...
When it's all over, I'll call you for company, that's your medici~i~ine...
I'll be trying to come back to me, she needs me more than you do|I'll be happy for you, whether I'm there, whether you're not
I'll be happy for you, whether I'm there, whether you're not|Whether we're anywhere, anywhere|Anywhere, anywhere
Always lonely in a crowd|I don't always mean to talk so loud
Tell thе fishes, I say "hello"|I'll make somе wishes and burn them in the sno~o~ow...
I don't need a place in your happiness, for me to feel happy for you|I just want to see you smile, whenever I can
When you were dreaming I looked in, I saw everything|I saw fresh new grass, that's growing, it's growing
You've got a big, big heart, it's showing, it's showing|I never knew you like that, it's something quite special
I'm addicted to getting on your level|Never wanted to make it all blue|I just wanted to get into bed
I'm walking through the sweet sweet memories, I keep for nights|When I can't sleep, I remember all the times we loved
I remember all the places we could only go, just you and I|Lovers by night, but when the day came, we were back to the same
I'm a lover, I feel it now|I'm a lover, just never knew how
So let me love you, whatever the weather
Mm, you're trouble|Mm, it's trouble, but it bubbles right over
And makes me feel over the moon|You make me feel over the moon
Taking turns to|Draw a circle in the sand|Your hand quivers|And I shiver
On days you'd sail away|I would try to find my own way home
Oh the loss of you, the loss of you|Will haunt me through and through
Drifting driveby|Shoot at anything that moves
Slowly sinking|Ship nobody can rescue
Oh I've been waiting for you, waiting for you|To tell me where to go from here
Wake up, I'm right here|Been howling at you dear
A volcano erupted and the stars fell one by one|And finally I'm done right and it's a kite trapped in my mind
But I don't mind|I think of your hands on my body and they feel nice|Just one more night
And there's love pouring out my eyes and onto your plate|We've got it mighty fine, whenever we like
There's a velvet kind of mood|And the pleasure's like pudding and I'm winning and I'm sinning
Take a page from my dream that I'm living, I'm spinning
Thе world it keeps on turning|The world it keeps on turning
So tender, I'm еnded|Surrendered to you
I ache for you, but it doesn't paint me blue
I can't help thinking about all of the perks of loving you|Even if I have to hold this love alone until it passes through
I keep thinking about all of the work I had to do|But it all fades away to nothing when I think of you
I'm sick with love, it's got me where it hurts|Got struck from above, if only these things worked
Would it be alright if we sat side by side and didn't say a single word?|Just let ourselves drown in the sweet sunny silence|And maybe we'd just know why it can't be so
I've been lonely since I woke up|I want a touch-- no, it's never enough
I heard his voice then had a cry|Made me remember all the reasons why
I wanna give you all I've got|Until I'm not even a thought
You've been hanging out in my head|I've been imagining you in my bed
But my imagination can only go|Only go so far|Only go so far
I want the real thing|I want it bad|Want you to hold me like you never have
Can our bodies meet again|Like it's the first time|Like there's no time
I wanna give you all I've got|Until my body begins to rot
It's okay to feel so small|Got ten foot walls towering above you
You lay bare on the rooftop|No one there, nobody to love you
Colossal clouds, colors of the dark|Galaxies never found
My little spark observing its big spark
Turn on the stars, the street lamps of Mars|I've been waiting for the night to fall
Turn on the stars, the street lamps of Mars|I'll rest until the birds go
Suspended in nostalgia|I find your name hanging in my memories
I fill myself up with your gaze|Oh, what a maze you've put me in
I spy with my little eye|Your wide eyes that take me time traveling
It feels like, swimming, swimming with my eyes closed|Nose to nose, you just, you just fucking know
Oh, remind me of your name again|As you take me on that train again
Back to the pavements that we walked, and walked|Oh, the drugs that made us talk and talk
And I'll take you dancing, I'll take you round and round|I'll lead you to the hilltops, and I'll take you on the ground
I may be daydreaming, but I'll be wondering what it's like|To be under your skin|'Til I get in
Until you let me out|Until you see my insides|Until you're inside out
I'll lick my wounds, feels like I've had them since the womb|Sing myself a tune, fall back and swoon
I may be daydreaming|Oh what a feeling|Daydreaming about you
My mind is filled with galaxies|It's all I see|It's all I see
Way up in the highest trees|I feel the breeze|I feel the breeze
Take me on your boat one day|We'll fade away, we'll slip away
We'll go down the longest stream|Reflected in a sunbeam
Just a speck of dust in the Milky Way|We'll fade away, we'll slip away
But we are alive today|We'll be ok|We'll be ok
I'm not going|I'm not going|I'm not going|I'm not going|I'm not going, going, gone
I'm no white dove|But I stand here with all my love
Grab the hand that's reaching out|Face out to an empty room where no one's there to hear their prayers
On the road through the fog|Through the smoke with my heart in my throat
I used to hide from my own mind|This battle's not mine, oh, no
The building a motor on houses of paper|This world can cater for us all
When the sun rises, it rises for us all|When the sun rises, it rises for us all
Every plant given life by His hands|Every stone placed to build pathways in the sand
There was a magical feeling surrounding that land|A mystical feeling surrounding that land
And I'd curl up on my mother with the fire ablaze|My memories of then are a haze
But I can still smell the fynbos after a night's rain|And the fairies and the magic that blossomed from our brains
And there's a child in the treetops, is she still me?
My heart opens as the swing drops|I've got bruises on my knees
And I look up into the ether|The sunset and the breeze
Nothing has made me quite as happy|As my home, my home among the trees
The moon was full and it left me howling|My head was spinning and my heart was growling
I received crimson stains on my sheets that morning|The world felt big and the tides were moving
And I stopped caring too much about my outside|I stopped caring too much about my outside
Didn't wanna be told what I'm supposed to look like|Didn't wanna be told what makes a woman look right
So I took off my clothes|And I jumped right in|The 3 AM water|It soaked my skin
The full moon tide was up to my chin|I looked at you and your mischief grin
You better cut off your wings cause you're held up by strings now|Cut off your wings 'cause you're held up by strings now
Why did they lie?|They said to survive I had to walk along the line
But I don't feel alive, does that mean I've survived?|Does that mean I've survived?
What kind of living is this?|I don't wanna simply exist
I wanna punch with my fist|I wanna roll with the misfits|Meander in the mist
Give in to the bliss|Grab life by her wrist|Lean in for a kiss and say, "I want this"|"Oh, I need this"
I wanna live like I mean it|I'm gonna take it, not leave it
I've never been one for leaving|But I need something to believe in|Something that shakes me|Watch how I'm waking
I'm yours for the taking|I'm newborn, I'm shaking
Never been one for leaving|But now I'm leaving
'Cause my heart's still beating|And there's nothing as fleeting|As a life before expiry
Tonight I'm feeling fiery|I'll set fire to everything|Everything that meant something
And the ocean roared|And the ocean howled|And the ocean roared|And the ocean howled
I saw you throw your hands in the air and say a prayer|Your eyes closed, your nose breathing in the salty air
There was nothing you could do to make me love you anymore
You said, "What I despair in you|I don't feel like I'm going anywhere with you|I might as well fling myself into your ocean|At least then I'll would be with you"
So you jumped down from the cliff you'd climbed to|Into paradise that lay below you|I could only stare|And let my tears fall in the ocean
I've got so much to say|And yet nothing comes close|To the way we communicate|When we don't say a word
I hear you clearly without sounds|Oh, I don't need these ears when you're around
Make me happy|Make me sweat|Here's my body, and it's dripping wet
And I want you to show me the way back|Oh, I want you to give me what I lack
Communicate like trees|Way down under the ground|Where we've got so much going on|Like a whole other hidden universe
And I don't think that I wanna leave just yet|Can I just stay here, stay here|Here in our underworld?
Make me laugh and then|Pull at my heartstrings|Till I cry like a baby on a full-moon night
Tonight I don't wanna be anything|But a girl in a cute dress, a cute mess
Is there nothing for me here|Did I read it wrong
Could you not make your mind up dear|Did I just lead it on
You stared at me|All silly and sweet|Then I turned away|Turned back
You had blown the candles out|And I was left in the dark
I tried to think light|But what I wanted was sweet surrender|Sweetest surrender
You could have it right now|And wouldn’t have to choose
Take it up in your arms|What do you have to lose
And when you find me|On my knees|I am eager to please|Everything that you are|Anything that you need
Your body makes me feel|Shiny and gold like hidden treasure|Oh what a pleasure
You think that I’m kinda silly|I know I know I know I know
You think that I’m lookin pretty|I see the way you look at me
I’ve thought of so many ways to try to take you home|Take you home|Take you home
I’ve thought of a million ways to tell you|I think you’re cool and I think I want you
Did I wake up in the wrong world|Or am I in some kind of paradise
Well I’m walking just past midnight|I’m alone all alone|Ah, just me and the moon
And I’ve got quite an appetite|Should I stay alone|Or should I call you up call you up
Maybe I’ll have a little drink and a little smoke|Mull it over think it out|Before I just call you up after midnight
On such an empty night|Could I enjoy it for myself|Or do I need some company
Is it that easy to call someone up|And tell them to wrap their arms around me
It’s easy when the world’s asleep|And it’s so easy when it’s all at my feet
I’ll just follow my feet|Meet myself on an unfamiliar street|Until I finally find nothing|Maybe nothing’s what I need
Ah, just me and the moon|Ah, just me and the moon
I'm all that I’ve got|Can't be all you've got too|There’s not enough room in here for all of you
I'll give you more whenever I'm ready|I didn't ask to give up my privacy
I'm just one girl|Don't wanna rule the world|I just wanna make make my own|Won't you let me|Let me
I've given my time and love to so many|But I don’t have enough to give what you expect me
I’m going out alone|Alone feels just right|Let me
My shoulders are tired from holding such weight|I'm putting it all down|Taking it off|Lеtting it drip down
I will not be around|I will be somewhеre that I can only reach|Not open to the public|Not open to anyone|Not open not open|Let me
If you were here|We’d have a ball|I’d take your hand and we’d fall
But in the wake of what you left|I will forever remain
If you were here|I’d touch your skin|I’d bury everything
I’d kiss your forehead|And make a wish|And we’d be all embracing
I’d run a bath for us to sit in|Light some candles your face would flicker in
And I’d crumble at the thought of what we could be|And I’d crumble at the beauty of what might be
You've got something I want always|Never quite enough|Never coming down
I’ve got something|I wanna give you for nothing|I'll be forever there|Whether you care|Whether you care
Take me seriously and take me up in your arms|Give me nothing and everything in between
You make me scream|You make me feel it all|You make me wanna shine|And you'll be on your knees honey
We've got ourselves|But maybe we could have each other too
Treat me like you feel me|I've got so much love|Don't know how to get it all out
I'm there standing all still|And then shaking, moving, levitating
Love enough to fill a thousand hearts|I'll wait until it gets all dark
Now everybody do the shake|Let’s shake it out let’s take a break|Shake with me until there’s nothing left
It’s not the end, it’s the start
Well I’ve got things I wanna scream and shout|And I’ve got things that really freak me out|But even when I’m on the edge of my cliff|Well I can shout your name into the abyss
Well I’ve got things I wanna say out loud|And I don’t always get the words right out|But I don’t wanna wait till we grow old|I wanna kiss you like our lives depеnd on it
Well I saw hearts all up in your eyеs|Don’t worry I won’t tell anyone
Let’s just try to have a good old time|You know we all deserve to feel that some time
Well I’ve got stars coming out of my mouth|I seem to throw them up on everyone
It’s so good to have a little hope|I watched the world go wild and so can I
I take out the stones from my pockets|And balance them like my brother does
And even though I’ll never see the end of the road|I know it’s there and that’s enough
And even though I might see the end of your love|I know it’s there and that’s enough
Am I playing a role|Is this all just a part|Am I saying some lines|That don’t come from the heart
Am I saying yes|When I really mean no|Am I putting it on|Is it all part of the show
Am I selling a dream|That doesn’t even exist|Am I doing enough|To rebel to resist
Shake it off baby|You’ve got it all figured out you’re doing just fine
You've never done nothing|But try to feel alright
Pick your fights and try to be kind|Say how you feel even when it gets real, oh
We’re getting harder on the outside and softer on the inside
Do it yourself that’s the only time it’s done right|I’ve tried a million times but I never really got it just right
But that’s the beauty of the game|It’s a game and you don’t need to win
It’s child’s play honey|The way you shake it all up|It’s child’s play honey|Thе way you make me feel like I was just born
Calm the fuck down|And unclench your fists|I can't see you through the mist|How did it come to this?
Wipe the tears|From inside your head|Your eyes are looking dead|Was it something I said?
Take back those words|I'm not as strong as I look|It's my soul that you shook|And my heart that you took
Leave me in my misery|Hopefully I'll forget you someday|I can't stay|I have to stop my soul's decay
You've taken all my dignity|It's clear to me that this ain't child's play|I'll be on my way|Before my world turns grey
Hey! Hey you!|Yes, you standing there|Is this fair?|Or would you give me care
Hey! Hey you!|Yes, you with the smile|Would you take me under your wing|For a while?
There once was an island|further than any boat had reached|and she sat there in silence|alone but at ease
A spell was upon her|her body could never leave|but her mind would travel multitudes|you and I could not conceive
When the night sky's your only friend|When you're tired of playing pretend|When the ground under your feet|Seems like no more than a dream
And you're in over your head|And your instincts are not fed|Well, you're not free|You don't feel free
There's no time to be|On that island with me|far away from the city|from the litter and poverty|from the fast paced monotony
Oh, he stands in front of me|And he's staring manically|Screaming|Oh society, what have you done to me?
The ground I've tread so many years|All this blood and sweat and tears|Just to be inside your mould|And do just what I'm told
If only I had been so bold|But now my body's getting old|And time is oh so golden|If only it could be frozen
But you took it away from me|Oh society|You took it away from me|Oh my liberty
When you brainwashed me with formulas of how I should be|Shaped me and r*ped me of my individuality
Schooled me and fooled me|Told me what I could and could not see|Took me and shook me|Of my urges to be free
The sky was red, he stared ahead|I saw him tread, one step more|Gets out of bed, he fills with dread|His dreams are dead, money makes him poor
He's been misled|Life's flown overhead|Overhead|Overhead
There's a bird trapped in his head but he ignores it instead|And his spirit has long fled and now he is hard to the core
She could have lead him to the rich sky|Wonders why she's not around anymore
He said I can lead you to the red sky|If you just stop asking why|If you just stop asking why|If you just stop asking why
And I said I will reach deep down inside|And stare with you ahead and give you all my red|And put it in your head and in your heart
And I will part and you will stay|But I will still dream of one day|Might not be so far away|Might not be so far away
I treated you bad my dear|I'll blame it on fear|To help my own ears
And I put myself first my love|I pushed and I pushed|And I shoved and I shoved
Sometimes I can't breathe|And I push you out to sea|And leave you drowning|Drowning
And you, you, my soul, my friend|You know that I know|That this ain't the end
And you opened my heart again|But things they have changed now|And we can't pretend
But we've got mountains to climb|And sure I'm happy when you're mine|But we're drowning|Drowning
Awake from your slumber|You’ve been sleeping far too long
Your eyes have been shut tight|I’d like to pry them wide for just one day
I found your naked body|Out in the fields|An empty shell down in a well|I’m sure it felt like hell
You had blood on your hands|And mud on your feet|And I said, hey, I knew i’d meet you one day
And like the wind from the east|I swept you away|I swept you away|I swept you away
Then you rose from the day|Gave your eyes to the sun|And you looked at me|Said I’m not the only one
Music came back to your ears|And you danced and you danced|For all of the years|You’d forgotten how|To live for the now
We got footsteps moving slow|We got less power and more control
We got a man up there|Who's so big and bold|It's getting old
Well I was walking in the garden|And the first signs of morning were pewing through the leaves|And my blue suede shoes were collecting dew|And the path it was leading back to you, you, you, you, you
Well I was walking in the cathedral|And the stained glass windows were shining down on me|And the whispering voices were echoing inside|And the candles they were burning just for you, you, you, you, you
Well I've walked, I've walked as far as my feet can go|And I've tripped I've fallen on the muddy road
But the path to home can't always be chosen by you|Or me|Is this the way it's gonna be?
Oh no, I hope you see me when the day is done|I never knew, I never dreamed of anyone like you, you, you, you, you
I've seen the dreadlocked man sit by the magic tree|Singing songs of the wise the wise and the free
And the bike slipped from beneath my drunken weight|And my body, it became the tar's evening bait|But none of this is fate
And I've crawled through the bushes and the spiders and thorns|To delve beyond the barrier of the celebration core
I'm just an innocent outlaw|But I know that it's good that I'm doing this for...
It's all lies|It's all lies|It's all lies|It's all lies|It's all lies|It's all lies
And my limbs have danced for the Amsterdam sunrise|With not one restriction and not one disguise
Monotony is what I despise|Integration to society would be my demise|It's all lies
One foot on the pavement and one foot in the milky way|And I'm soaring|Soaring
My branches scrape the sea of stars|My roots dig deep into this world of ours|And I'm grounded|Grounded
My reality is what I perceive|What I attract into my orbit
Worries fade into the haze|The air feels different this time 'round|Different this time 'round
Let's set sail|Start a fire|Learn to live a little higher
Let's pick the lock|Grab the reigns|Forget there ever were chains|'Cause there never were chains|Never were chains
Days move on and times they change|In a blink of an eye, things rearrange
We're moving|Moving|We're sucked in and we're spat out|On the other side of the rabbit hole|But we find our way|Find our way
Do you want to be just a machine in this crazy society?
Babe, have you seen those leaves on the ground?|At first they shone from the pavement in gold red and brown|And they've been trampled on and ridden over
And they're just sludge lying around|And I think it's time to leave this town
The trees whisper secrets of summer's love affairs|Of the carelessness tomfoolery that happened everywhere
But as the doors close|And the wind blows|The city sleeps|And the sky weeps|And I know, I know|I know it's time to leave this town|Oh no, you won't see me hanging around
But babe, I'll be back|When the sun starts to seep through the leaves
When I can sing you a song|As you sing along|On these magic berlin streets
With our night riding,|Midnight gliding|Morning dancing,|Pavement prancing|You know oh you know|You know I'll be back to live this town|Oh you know I'll be back to love this town
